    "# Grid.gg Esports Match Prediction Pipeline\n",
    "This notebook implements a machine learning pipeline for predicting esports match outcomes using the Grid.gg API data. The pipeline includes data cleaning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline Structure\n",
    "The pipeline is organized into the following main sections:\n",
    "1. Data Collection and Cleaning\n",
    "    - Reading in combined_player_stats_20241117_1343.csv\n",
    "    - Handling missing values and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Development and Evaluation\n",
    "Three models will be developed and compared:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Neural Network: Designed for complex pattern recognition in player performance\n",
    " - XGBoost: Proven effectiveness in similar prediction tasks historically with our data and within Shaynes models\n",
    " - [Additional Model TBD]: To be selected based on feature characteristics and data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Optimization Possibilities \n",
    "    - Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "    - Feature importance analysis\n",
    "    - Performance validation\n",
    "    - Cross-validation strategies"

    "### Data Loading and Initial Assessment\n",
    "- Loading data from 'combined_player_stats_20241117_1343.csv'\n",
    "- Initial examination of data structure and completeness\n",
    "- Documentation of current data shape and basic statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Issues to Address\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Known Invalid Records\n",
    "    - Identification and removal of ~55 batches of players with all zero statistics\n",
    "    - Documentation of removed records for future data collection improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Partial Zero Statistics\n",
    "    - Analysis of players with some zero statistics but otherwise valid data\n",
    "    - Determination of valid zero values vs. missing/error data\n",
    "    - Strategy for handling partially complete player records\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Team Information Linking\n",
    "    - Assessment of available team information\n",
    "    - Preparation for linking player statistics with match results\n",
